# Recipes
This repo is just a list of recipes I've found that are relatively easy to make and taste good.

## What types of diet are these recipes for
These recipes aren't *strictly* Keto recipes, but I try and lean towards those sorts of recipes when possible. I don't really like using expensive, one-off ingredients I'll never use again, like Coocnut Oil, or some other weird thing, so you won't see much of that here.
